# Twitter Microservices Example

## Problem Statement
In Twitter's early days, the platform experienced significant scaling issues as its popularity surged. The primary reasons for these issues included:

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: All functionalities were tightly coupled, making it hard to scale specific parts of the system.
2. **Single Database**: Over-reliance on a single relational database created performance bottlenecks.
3. **Lack of Redundancy**: Limited mechanisms to distribute the load during high-traffic spikes.

### Outcome
These issues caused frequent outages, symbolized by the infamous "Fail Whale" error during peak usage.

## Solution: Transition to Microservices
To address these issues, Twitter moved to a **Microservices Architecture**, which involved:

1. **Decoupling Functionalities**: Breaking the system into smaller, independent services (e.g., User Service, Tweet Service).
2. **Distributed Databases**: Using horizontally scalable NoSQL databases to handle large data volumes.
3. **Load Balancers**: Adding caching and redundancy mechanisms to manage traffic efficiently.

## Project Overview
This project replicates the microservices-based solution with two services:

1. **User Service**:
   - Handles user-related operations like creating users.
2. **Tweet Service**:
   - Manages tweet-related operations like creating tweets and linking them to users.

### Key Features
- Independent services for `User` and `Tweet` operations.
- Communication between services via APIs.
- Scalable and modular architecture.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x installed.
2. `Flask` library installed. Run the following command to install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

### Project Structure
```
.
|-- user_service.py
|-- tweet_service.py
```

### Steps to Run

1. **Start the User Service**:
   ```bash
   python user_service.py
   ```
   - The User Service will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

2. **Start the Tweet Service**:
   ```bash
   python tweet_service.py
   ```
   - The Tweet Service will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5002`.

## Testing the Services
You can test the APIs using **Postman**, **cURL**, or any HTTP client.

### 1. Create a User
- **Endpoint**: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/users`
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Ali"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ali"
  }
  ```

### 2. Create a Tweet
- **Endpoint**: `POST http://127.0.0.1:5002/tweets`
- **Body** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, this is my first tweet!"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, this is my first tweet!"
  }
  ```

## Summary
This project demonstrates how to use microservices to resolve scalability issues in a system like Twitter. By decoupling functionalities into separate services and ensuring modularity, we achieve:

- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn’t impact the entire system.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Smaller, focused services are easier to manage and update.

This architecture aligns with Twitter’s transition to a microservices-based system, significantly improving its performance and reliability.
